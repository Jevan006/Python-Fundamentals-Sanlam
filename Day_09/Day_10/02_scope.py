# # get_price
# 1. First checks for local `price` variable
# 2. Then goes to outer scope (Lexical scope)

# Case 2:

# price = 200


# def get_price():
#     print("The old price is: ", price)  # 200
#     # price = 100
#     print("The new price is: ", price)  # 200

# Case 2:
# price = 200


# def get_price():
#     print("The old price is: ", price)
#     price = 100
#     print("The new price is: ", price)


# get_price()


# # Case 3: Both same variable name (Outside & Inside)
# price = 200  # Live under the shadow
# # Local scope given higher priority


# def get_price():
#     price = 100  # Shadowing # Legend
#     print("The old price is: ", price)  # 100
#     print("The new price is: ", price)  # 100


# get_price()


# Case 4: Python locally the price is present
# price = 200


# def get_price():
#     print("The old price is: ", price)  # UnboundLocalError
#     price = 100  # Assign value

# get_price()


# print(a)

# 2 Phase Execution
# 1. Compilation - Declaration noted
# 2. Execution  - print the value

# def get_price():
#     print("The old price is: ", price)  # Do we know price? Yes. UnboundLocalError 🤚

#     print("The old price is: ", price) #  Do we price. Yes. ✅ print
#     print("The new price is: ", price)  #  Do we price. Yes. ✅ print


# get_price()


# Case 5:
price = 200


def get_price(price):
    print("The old price is: ", price)
    price = 100  # Reassignment
    print("The new price is: ", price)


get_price(600)

# Summary
# 1. Local gets perfernce
# 2. UnboundLocalError -> If you try access before declaration
# 3. Only functions creates new scope in python


### Assignment:
# Write a comparison in terms of scope on keywords
# globsl vd non locsl
# with examples
