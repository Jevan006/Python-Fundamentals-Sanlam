## Control flow

1. Decision tree
1. 'if..else'
1. 'if..elif..else'
1. Loops
1. 'while'
1. 'for'

## While

executes the statement while the condition is true or until the condition is false

# Refactor while loop

i = 1

while i <= 3:
print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
i = i + 1

    print("Voting EndedðŸŽŠ")

## For

# Refactor in 'for' loop

# for and range (pair)

# always start from 0 when counting

for i in range (3):
print(i)

## Loops

Purpose: Simply repeating statements

```py
print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
```

### `while`

Executes the statement while the condition is `True`

```py
while (condition)

```

```py
i = 1

while i <= 3:
    print("Vote for Jevan ðŸŽŠ")
    i = i + 1

print("Voting Ended ðŸŽŠ")
```

## GIT

Linus Torvalds invented Git to manage Linux
Git does not need internet - he wanted to work on plane

1. git init
2. stage All
3. provide message - Why? > What?
4. When to commit?
   1. atleast 3 times a hour
   2. logical commit - complete commit (no bugs)
   3. small commit - don't commit 10 files
5. sync to github (online)

# Difference between git and github

Git - Version control system
Github - GDrive (storing files)

# .ipynb

# Common methods for string & List

2. Index: +ve, -ve
3. len

5. concatenation (+)
6. repetition (\*)

# CRUD - List

1. Read - index & Slice
2. Update - append & insert
3. Delete - Remove & PurposeCreate - []

# append

- append adds at the end of the list everytime
